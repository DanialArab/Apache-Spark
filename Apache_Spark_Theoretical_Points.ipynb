    "1. Spark runs programs up to 100x faster than Hadoop MapReduce in memory \n",
    "\n",
    "2. What is big datta?\n",
    "Data that can fit on a local computer, in the scale of 0-32 GB depending on RAM, is not big data. \n",

    "    + **Try using a SQL database to move storage onto hard drive instead of RAM**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    + **Or use a distributed system, that distributes the data to multiple machines/computer. This is where Spark comes to play.**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're using spark, you're at a point where it no longer makes sense to fit all your data on RAM and it no longer makes sense to fit all your data into a single machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Local vs. distributed system: \n",
    "\n",
    "a local system is probably what you're used to. It's just a single machine, a single computer.It all shares the same ram, the same hard drive. A local process will use the computation resources of a single machine. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a distributed system, you have one main computer, some sort of master node, and you also have data and calculations distributed onto the other computers. A distributed process has access to the computational resources across a number of machines connected through a network. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Scaling\n",
    "\n",
    "+ After a certain point, it's much easier to scale out to many lower CPU machines in a distributed system, than try to scale up to a single machine with a high CPU\n",
    "+ distributed machines also have the advantage of easily scaling. All you have to do is just add more machines versus a single computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "No matter how nice it is, there's going to be a limit on how much ram or how much storage you can add to a single machine. So in distributed machines, you can just keep adding systems to the network and just get more power\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Fault-tolerance\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributed machines also include fault tolerance, which is really important when you're talking about large data sets. If one machine fails, the whole network can still go on, which you can't do on a local machine if your local machine crashes due to some error in the calculation you just lost all your calculation, all your data and fault tolerance is a fundamental idea where you're going to be replicating your data across multiple machines. So even if one goes down, your calculations and your data still persists and goes on.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Distributed architecture of Haddop\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Hadoop is a way to distribute very large files across multiple machines.\n",
    "    + It uses the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS)\n",
    "    + HDFS allows a user to work with large data sets\n",
    "    + HDFS also duplicates blocks of data for fault tolerance\n",
    "    + It also then uses MapReduce\n",
    "    + MapReduce allows computations on that data\n",
    "\n",
    "So we kind of have two fundamental ideas here:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Hadoop is distributed file system, which is the way that we get a really large data set distributed across multiple machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "+ And then we have the idea of MapReduce, which allows computations across the distributed data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Distributed storage - HDFS\n",
    "    + HDFS will use blocks of data, with a size of 128 MB by default\n",
    "    + Each of these blocks is replicated 3 times\n",
    "    + The blocks are distributed in a way to support fault tolerance\n",
    "    + Smaller blocks provide more parallelization during processing\n",
    "    + Multiple copies of a block prevent loss of data due to a failure of a node\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "9. MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "    + MapReduce is a way of splitting a **computation task** to a distributed set of files (such as HDFS)\n",
    "    + It consists of a Job Tracker and multiple Task Trackers\n",
    "\n",
    "10. What we covered can be thought of in two distinct parts:\n",
    "    + Using HDFS to distribute large data sets\n",
    "    + Using MapReduce to distribute a computational task to a distributed data set\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark improves on the concepts of using distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "11. Spark is a flexible alternative to MapReduce NOT to Hadoop\n",
    "\n",
    "So don't think of spark in the concepts of Hadoop versus Spark, but instead  MapReduce versus Spark.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Spark vs MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "    + MapReduce requires files to be stored in HDFS, Spark does not! Spark can use data stored in a variety of formats\n",
    "    \n",
    "            Cassandra\n",

    "\n",
    "            And more\n",
    "\n",
    "    + Spark also can perform operations up to 100x faster than MapReduce\n",
    " \n",
    "13. So how does spark achieve this speed?\n",
    "\n",
    "    + MapReduce writes most data to disk after each map and reduce operation\n",
    "    + Spark keeps most of the data in memory after each transformation\n",
    "    + Spark can spill over to disk if the memory is filled\n",
    "\n",
    "14. Spark RRD \n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of Spark is the idea of a Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)\n",
    "Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) has 4 main features:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Distributed Collection of Data\n",
    "+ Fault-tolerant\n",
    "+ Parallel operation - partioned\n",
    "+ Ability to use many data sources\n",
    "\n",
    "RDDs are **immutable, lazily evaluated, and cacheable**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of Spark operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "+ Transformations: Transformations are basically a recipe to follow.\n",
    "+ Actions: Actions actually perform what the recipe says to do and returns something back.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. Transformations vs actions behavior \n",
    "\n",
    "The behavior of transformations versus actions also carries over to the syntax when coding. A lot of times when you write a method call off of a data frame which we're going to be working with with pyspark, you won't see anything as a result until you call an action something like show. And this makes sense because if you're working with a really large data set, you don't want to constantly be calculating all the transformations. Maybe a transformation can be something like take the average or take the count of a particular data, or show me where column X is greater than the number two, etc. like that. But you don't want to actually calculate that every time until you're sure you want to perform it because it's such a huge data set. It's quite a task to calculate everything every time you type something. So that's why everything is separated between transformations and then those calls to action.\n",
    "\n",
    "16. Spark DataFrames are also now the standard way of using Spark’s Machine Learning Capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "17. why Linux? \n",
    "\n",
    "Realistically Spark won't be running on a single machine. That's basically the whole point of spark. Your data is so large that it no longer fits on a single machine and you're going to need to run it on a cluster on a service like Google Cloud or Amazon Web Services. **And these cluster services will pretty much always be on a Linux based system.** They're not running Mac OS or Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "Employers and the real world is really focused on Linux when it comes to spark, which makes sense because if you're running it on a cluster, it's going to be on a Linux based system.\n",
    "\n",
    "18. findspark library\n",
    "\n",
    "I need to install find Spark library to not be needing to change directory every time and instead, being able to import Spark from any directory so I don't have to worry about changing directory to that spark home directory.\n",

    "\n",
    "19. Intro to Spark DF \n",
    "\n",
    "Spark in its early days began with something known as the **RDD syntax**, which was a little ugly and a bit tricky to learn. Fortunately, now, Spark 2.0 and higher has shifted towards a **data frame syntax**, which is much cleaner and easier to work with. And this **data frame syntax looks really similar across all the APIs**, which is nice. Meaning if you've already done a course in something like Scala and Spark Learning Python and Spark data frames is really easy. A lot of that stuff looks extremely similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "20. How to define Schema\n",
    "\n",
    "Often if you're not dealing with data that's really nice, or maybe from a particular source, you need to actually clarify what the schema is. So in order to do certain operations, the schema has to be correct. It has to know what columns are strings, what columns are integers, etc..\n",
    "\n",
    "        from pyspark.sql.types import StructField,StringType,IntegerType,StructType\n",
    "        \n",
    "        data_schema = [StructField(\"age\", IntegerType(), True),StructField(\"name\", StringType(), True)]\n",
    "\n",
    "        final_struc = StructType(fields=data_schema)\n",
    "\n",
    "        df = spark.read.json('people.json', schema=final_struc)\n",
    "        \n",
    "21. How to grab data from a spark DataFrame\n",
    "**df['age']** gives me back the column object but if I actually want to get a data frame with that singular column so that I can see the results I use the select method:\n",
    "\n",
    "**df.select('age').show()**\n",
    "\n",
    "So the main differences between these two methods is the fact that one of them, the first one, is returning back a column, while the second one is returning a data frame that contains a single column, so we have a lot more methods and attributes we can call off of that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You get a lot more flexibility with a data frame of a single column versus just a column So a lot of times we use select instead of just grabbing that column object.\n",
    "\n",
    "df.head(2) gives me back a list of row object.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the reason there are so many specialized objects, such as a column object or a row object, is because of **Spark's ability to read from a distributed data source and then map that out to distributed computing.**\n",
    "\n",
    "to select multiple columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**df.select(['age', 'name'])**\n",
    "\n",
    "22. Adding new column using **withColumn method**\n",
    "\n",
    "withColumn method basically returns a new dataframe by adding in a column or replacing an existing column. This is not an in place operation and we would have to save this to a new dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "23. Renaming a column using withColumnRenamed method\n",
    "\n",
    "**df.withColumnRenamed('old_col_name', 'new_col_name')**\n",
    "\n",
    "24. Using pure SQL to directly deal and interact with the spark data frame\n",
    "\n",
    "First I need to register the DataFrame as a SQL temporary view then I can pass in direct SQL queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "**df.crerateOrReplaceTempView('people')**\n",
    "\n",
    "**results = spark.sql(\"SELECT * FROM people WHERE age=30\")**\n",
    "\n",
    "**results.show()**\n",
    "\n",
    "What's really awesome is if you already have a lot of SQL knowledge, you can leverage that with spark SQL and you can do complicated operations really quickly in case you happen to forget some of the more basic spark data frame operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "25. How to filter data when you grabed it\n",
    "\n",
    "A large part of working with data frames is the ability to quickly filter out data based on conditions. Spark data frames are built on top of that Spark SQL platform, which means, as we previously discussed, if you already know SQL, you could quickly and easily grab that data using SQL commands. However, we're really going to be using the data frame methods as our focus for the course. but here is what it looks like using SQL:\n",
    "\n",
    "**df.filter(\"Close < 500\").select([\"Open\", \"Close\"]).show()**\n",
    "\n",
    "but the above operation using normal python comparison operations is like:\n",
    "\n",
    "**df.filter(df[\"Close\"] < 500).select([\"Open\", \"Close\"]).show()**\n",
    "\n",
    "The key things to keep in mind here is that I'm using dot filter and then passing in the column, some comparison operator and then the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "**filtering based on multiple conditions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "**df.filter((df[\"Close\"] < 500) & ~(df[\"Open\"] > 200)).show()**\n",
    "\n",
    "26. collect method\n",
    "\n",
    "And when you're working in the real world with data, a lot of times you're going to want to collect stuff so you can actually work with that variable later on. Often in this course, we'll just using we'll just be using **show** so you can actually see stuff, but we don't really need to collect it. But **in real life you'll probably be collecting more often than showing.**\n",

    "\n",
    "So one of the main quirks when dealing with the MLlib is that you need to format your data. So eventually just has one or two columns. And if you're using a supervised learning algorithm, the two columns are going to be features and labels, for unsupervised it's just a features column.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically what that means is if you have a data set with a ton of feature columns, you eventually need to **condense those all down to just a singular column** where each entry in that singular column, so the rows, is actually just an array consisting of all those old entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "So overall, this requires a little more data processing work than some other machine learning libraries. But the big upside and the whole reason for all this data processing work is that **that exact same syntax will work with distributed data**. So if you have a huge data set, you don't need to learn a new syntax for it. So that's no small feat for what's actually going on under the hood with Python and spark. It just requires you to put in a little more work with data processing using different **vector indexers**.\n",

    "34. **StringIndexer of spark vs. LabelEncoder and OneHotEncoder of scikit-learn**\n",
    "\n",
    "StringIndexer is similar to LabelEncoder in scikit-learn, in that it maps categorical values to numerical labels. However, unlike one-hot encoding, StringIndexer does not create new columns for each distinct value. Instead, it creates a **single column of numerical labels.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, one-hot encoding creates a binary vector for each distinct value in the categorical column, where each element in the vector represents the presence or absence of that value in the original column. This can create a sparse matrix with many zero elements, which can be useful in some machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if you want to use one-hot encoding in Spark, you can use the **OneHotEncoder transformer**. However, you should note that unlike scikit-learn's LabelEncoder, which assigns numerical labels based on **the alphabetical order of the distinct values**, StringIndexer in Spark assigns numerical labels based on **the frequency of occurrence of each distinct value in the column**. This can be useful in some cases where you want to assign **higher importance to more frequent values**, but you should be aware of this difference if you are using Spark's StringIndexer instead of scikit-learn's LabelEncoder\n",
